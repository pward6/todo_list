# todo_list
Hi! This github repo is a basic To Do list made with python and django. It's my first experience with backend development so I wanted to learn basic CRUD. In this website, you can add a task to complete and mark the task as complete when it's done. When a task is created, you have the option the edit or delete. 

## Future Work
I'm currently adding user login functions. As it stands, someone can make an account and sign in, but it just taks everyone to the same homepage. I'd like to allow each user to make their own list.
